# Coroutine Stacks
![example workflow](https://github.com/nikita-nazarov/coroutine-stacks/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg)

This project is dedicated to creating an Intellij Plugin that will enhance the coroutine debugging experience by creating a view with the graph representation of coroutines and their stack traces, similar to how it is done in the  [Parallel Stacks](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Debugging_Multithreaded_Applications.html#parallel-stacks) feature of the JetBrains Rider IDE.
